# Legacy / duplicate projects

This TaskUp monorepo (`C:\Users\dania\Desktop\TaskUp`) is the canonical codebase going forward.

Other Desktop folders are legacy references only:
- `C:\Users\dania\Desktop\TaskUp-Frontend` (old Vite UI reference)
- `C:\Users\dania\Desktop\TaskUPv1` (old FastAPI backend on Render)

You can keep them for historical reference, but they are no longer required once the monorepo is deployed. Do not delete the monorepo folder.***
